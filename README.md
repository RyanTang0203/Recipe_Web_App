# Ethical Implications
- When developing a recipe web application, there are many ethical and professional responsibilties needed to ensure users are able to use the website safe and able to access the webrowser with ease. As Engineers, not only is our job to provide a recipe web application but also prioritize the privacy and safety of all users. Since the app will collect personal data of people's accounting information and personal preference, securing people's data is crucial. Some impacts that will be shown in the web application are easy accessibility, global/economic impacts, and environmental impacts.
- Easy accessibility for a web app is crucial as users should be able to access every part of the app with ease. For this, we are using a search bar that allows finding recipes, a way to filter recipes by ingredients and to click on a recipe and view all ingredients used in the recipe. The instructions used in a recipe will be clearly given as this can prevent confusions on what certain types of ingredients are used and prevent health risks such as undercooked ingredients or if someone has an alergy to a certain ingredient.
- Making this web application also has a gobal/economic impact to society. This app allows people to try different cuisines from around the world and also encourages people to try new recipes if they are wanting to revolve around a certain ingredient. This also offers access to any income household as recipes will show affordable meals as many face challenges to healthy eating due to no money, lack of nutritional information, or just not enough time. An impact this has is also giving recognition to where its due as we will be crediting original contents of the creator.
- A way this can environmentally impact users is by promoting reducing waste and encouraging more plant-based options. People usually have leftovers after they eat and a way to avoid wasting food in the future is using what you have in your home, controlling portions or eat the leftovers and check incase expired.
